# Sample Kusto Query Langauge (KQL) queries to analyse git commit history

These samples are tied to this blog post: [Analysing git commit history with Azure Data Explorer](https://blog.siliconvalve.com/posts/2024/02/06/analysing-git-commit-history-using-azure-data-explorer).

If you are using Visual Studio Code, consider installing the excellent [Kuskus extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rosshamish.kuskus-kusto-syntax-highlighting) to help with KQL syntax highlighting.

## Queries

- [Author commits by date](src/author_commits_by_date.kql).
- [Top committers](src/tops_committers.kql).
- [Commits per week](src/commits_per_week.kql).
